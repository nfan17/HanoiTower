# HanoiTower
No graphics Hanoi Tower game with solution generator in python. Includes solution generator and play options taking simple inputs. 

## Game Info
- Hanoi is a simple game where you start out with three rods and a number of discs, each of unique size. The discs are stacked on the left-most rod, largest to smallest.
- To win, you must move all discs from the left-most rode to the right-most rod. The rules are that you can only move a single disc at a time and cannot place a larger disc on top of a smaller disc.
  
## About
- This program uses an implementation of a numpy-based arraystack to simulate rods holding disc objects. Game solutions are generated using a basic recursion solution.
- Next goal is to implement a GUI next using PyGame
